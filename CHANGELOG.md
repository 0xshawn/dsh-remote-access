# Changelog

## 0.3.5 — 2026-10-30

Hardened subagent filter.

- Diagnosed a remaining subagent notification: a team subagent's client list row
  can omit `parentSessionId`, and the Session can be unlisted, so the previous
  label fallback emitted a notification named "Session".
- Check `ctx.sessions.subagentAddress` independently from the row lookup, skip
  `origin: subagent` and `depth > 0` rows, and skip unknown/unlisted Sessions
  instead of guessing a label.
- Includes the 0.3.4 main-view suppression.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-10-30

Main-session notification filter.

- Skip completion and failure notifications for the Session currently open in
  the page (its list row has `retainedBy.mainView`), because the user can already
  see that state. Pending approval/question notifications still fire.
- This removes the invalid completion notice after a user aborts the turn in the
  Session they are viewing.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-10-30

Settled-notification delay.

- Hold completion and failure notifications for three seconds after a session
  goes idle. Cancel the pending notification when a retry, queued continuation,
  or new pending interaction resumes the session, so transient failures that
  immediately retry do not produce an invalid notification.
- Pending-interaction notifications stay immediate; they are never delayed.
- Includes the 0.3.2 subagent filter (`ctx.sessions.subagentAddress`) so
  subagent completions and failures never notify.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-10-30

Subagent notification filter.

- Detect subagents with `ctx.sessions.subagentAddress()` before consulting the
  session-list row, so a subagent absent from the main list no longer raises a
  notification for its completion or failure. The row-parent check remains as a
  fallback for older service layouts.
- Subagent and removed sessions are documented as skipped; no other notification
  behavior changes.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-29

Failure notifications.

- Listen to the forwarded `api-session/error` event and pair it with the
  following running-to-idle transition, so a failed model call or aborted turn
  raises `Task failed: <title>` with the first line of the error instead of a
  generic completion notification.
- Stale errors (older than 15 seconds) fall back to the completion copy.
- Document the covered interactions: approval, user questions, and plan review
  are registered pending domains; any future `uiSession` pending domain gets the
  generic `Input needed` notification.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-28

Browser notifications.

- Add a `dsh.client` browser half (hand-written bundle, no build step) that
  raises Web Notifications when a top-level Session stops running, or when a
  session starts waiting for approval, plan review, or an answer.
- Notifications fire only while the page is hidden or unfocused and after the
  browser grants permission; the page asks once on the first click or keypress.
  Subagent and removed sessions are skipped, and clicking a notification
  focuses the dsh window.
- Add the `notifications` host config (default on) and inject
  `__DSH_REMOTE_ACCESS_NOTIFY__` for the client half.
- Limitations documented: page-based Web Notifications, no Web Push, page must
  stay open, requires a secure context, and titles appear in OS notifications.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-27

First-login form.

- Serve a token entry form (`loginPage`, default on) when an unauthenticated
  browser opens the bare deployment URL instead of the printed `?token=` URL.
  The form posts the token back to the relative index path and reuses the stock
  token exchange, cookie, proxy-mount, and clean-URL redirect.
- Only a request authority that already passes the Host/Origin fence receives
  the form; untrusted authorities keep the plain `401`, and a rejected token
  re-renders the form with an error.
- Implemented by wrapping `connection.authorizeIndex`; the stock method is
  restored on plugin disposal, and a missing seam disables the form without
  affecting the rest of the bundle.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-26

Initial release.

- Bundle patch appends `DSH_REMOTE_ACCESS_TRUSTED_HOSTS` authorities to the
  `/api` Host/Origin fence, keeping the invocation's `--trusted-host` values.
  One expression covers the dsh 0.2.0 `webRuntime` and 0.2.1 `webStartup`
  service layouts; `webRuntime` is preferred so a 0.2.0 wildcard bind keeps its
  bind-derived LAN authorities.
- Host plugin injects the host-owned transport hook into the served index so an
  authenticated non-loopback page reports the loopback view (`loopback`,
  default on).
- Host plugin pins the launch token from plugin config or `DSH_WEB_TOKEN`, so
  the authenticated URL survives restarts.
- Unit tests for config defaults, token resolution, index injection, and patch
  shape. Verified end to end on dsh 0.2.1-rc.2, 0.2.1-rc.3, and 0.2.0-rc.2.
